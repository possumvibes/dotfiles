# dotfiles
This folder contains dotfiles to set up my [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) environment, currently riding on the coattails of XFCE on Fedora 36.

I use [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) as my terminal emulator, [Fish](fishshell.com/) as my shell, and [Neovim](neovim.io/) as my primary editor, and I have configs for a variety of other terminals, editors, and suchlike as I investigate them.

I am managing dotfiles with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io). 

(I do not recommend installing this. it is not "organized" or "complete" and there are absolutely no guarantees about it working.)
