# DOTS as managed through GNU Stow!

This repo contains dotfiles to set up my [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) environment, currently riding on the coattails of XFCE on Fedora 36.

## CURRENTLY USING (last updated 2023-08-09):

- Dotfiles Management: [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
- Window Manager: [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), currently riding on the coattails of XFCE on Fedora 38.
- Terminal Emulator: [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- Editor: [kakoune](https://kakoune.org/)
- Shell: ZSH and [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)

## PREVIOUSLY USING (until July 2023):
- Dotfiles Management: [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io). Previous dots history is available at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/possumvibes/dotfiles) repo.
- Editor: [Neovim](neovim.io/). It's still on deck, but I prefer kakoune's selection-first model and approach to extending the editor.


(I do not recommend installing this. it is not "organized" or "complete" and there are absolutely no guarantees about it working, or staying stable.)
Everything under the /kakoune tree is under the UNLICENSE.
