# DOTS as managed through GNU Stow!
This repository is archived and no longer active. I have migrated my repositories to Codeberg.

This repo contains dotfiles to set up my [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) environment on [Void linux](https://voidlinux.org/).

## CURRENTLY USING (last updated 2025-05-07:

- Dotfiles Management: [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
- Window Manager: [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)
- Terminal Emulator: [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) and [XTerm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/)
- Multiplexer: Tmux
- Editor: [kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) and (n)vim
- Shell: ZSH and [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)

## PREVIOUSLY USING

### Until May 2025:
- Window Manager: [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org)

### Until November 2023:
- Window Manager: [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
- Shell: ZSH
- Editors: [Neovim](neovim.io/) and [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) are both fully retired.

### Until July 2023:
- Dotfiles Management: [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io). Last chezmoi-managed commit is [60bbcd](https://github.com/possumvibes/dotfiles/tree/60bbcd20b981f844197c40eb074131988ec28784). 
- Editors: [Neovim](neovim.io/). It's still on deck, but I prefer kakoune's selection-first model and approach to extending the editor. [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/)--I'm using it at work for ease of LSP, but it's frustratingly between vim and kak bindings and design approaches in ways that just do not work for my brain *or* my RSI.

## BEWARE YE WHO ENTER HERE
For real, these are for viewing only if you (reader) are not me (possumvibes, writer). Mind the license--I make absolutely no claims about their being stable...or functional....or not full of bonkers things like unbreakable loops and worse......(I really should clean that on up). Please note that all items under the `kakoune` tree are under the UNLICENSE unless otherwise indicated.
